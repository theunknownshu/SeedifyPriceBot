# Telegram Crypto Tracker

A telegram bot that uses the [Pancakeswap API](https://github.com/pancakeswap/pancake-info-api) to recieve the price of a token.

Currently being used for this bot on telegram: https://t.me/SeedifyPriceBot

I've never really used Github before but I've attached all the files in the "Releases" section. 

I'll upload the new files everytime I change something like adding a new currency.



To get the bot working all you need to do it add your Telegram Token to the bot.py file.

The run the bot use the bot.py file NOT the tracker.py
